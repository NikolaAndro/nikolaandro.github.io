## Bottom line

Brian offers his mistakes as an opportunity to learn from them and not make the same mistakes.

## Mistake Chasing Money

Brian tried chasing after money in stock market - thinking that he can get rich off of making good trades. That turned into a second job that was not really investing, but speculating rather. He wasted a lot of time and energy since it did not pay off in the end.

This is what many financially literate people say. All you can do is make the average the market makes. Beating the market is done by 1% of financial gurus.

### Round #1 - Penny Stocks

Made a lot by pure luck. He thought he was smart until he lost all he made.

### Round #2 - Stock Options

When turned $10,000 into $60,000 using call options, Brian continued and due to a scandal in a company he invested in, he lost most of his money. No amount of research can prepare you for those rare events. 

### Round 3 - Crypto

Brian sold crypto when gains when 10x. However, crypte then went to 100x. Lesson is that it is nearly impossible to time the market. 


### Reflection

Speculating did not help Brian make real progress toward building wealth. It was mentally exhausting and very risky.

### The Pivot

Brian then focused on **`picking value stocks, diversifying, and aiming for steady growth`.** For a few years he even beat the market with 20% of increaso of his value. However, if your investments are low $40,000 in his case, that is only $8,000 per year. He would have been better off just finding a side job and making more money. <span style="color:yellow;">Therefore, the problem was `THE SCALE`</span>. 

Brian focused on increasing the income, so he could invest more and truly benefit from compounding.

This became his new focus.<span style="color:yellow;"> He stopped seeing investing as primary wealth-building strategy and started viewing it as a part of a bigger plan. The more he earned, the more he could invest. Only then investing returns would make a real difference. </span>

Comes back to the saying:

> ***<span style="color:red;">Be good at what you do and money will find you.</span>***


## How To Become an Expert

The key factors:

1. The effort you're willing to put in.
2. The time you dedicate to mastering your craft.

### Effort:

Make the most out of your time at work. Ask for new opportunities and try to gain more skills.

***<span style="color:yellow;">The effort you put in is entirely up to you - that drive must come from within.</span>***

That is why it is crucial to choose a field or job you enjoy or at least don't mind. When you're in an area that plays to your strengths, putting in the effort becomes easier. But if you are stuck in a job that makes you miserable, it will be hard to stay motivated.

### Time:

The more years of experience youo have in a certain field, the more opportunities you will have in that field and higher-profile assignments.

***<span style="color:yellow;">The time you spend in your field is an investment, and how you use that time determines your success. If you want to increase your income, becoming an expert is key. Expertise takes time and effort, so it's important to choose a field you can commit to for the long term. As your experience grows, so will your value, and that will be reflected in your earnings.</span>***

## Switching Careers

Switching careers too often will leave you with beeing a mediocre in all the fields you tried out while if you stick with the field you started with and become an expert, you will be compensated much more than if you stayed mediocre in some other field.

If you want to change your field, choose carefully and choose EARLY. Choose a field where top performers earn an income you;d be satisfied with and that you enjoy or at least don't mind.

## The Missing Link: Visibility And Income Growth

People need to know you exist and understand the value you bring. Without visibility, your expertise goes unnoticed and you miss out on hte financial rewards you deserve.

Practical steps to get noticed and show the value of your expertise:

1. Leverage online platforms and social media - show your skills online.
2. Network within your industry - attend conferences, webinars, or emetups to interact with peers
3. Ask for recommendations 

> ***<span style="color:yellow;">Don't just be the best - make sure people know it.</span>***

# Ch. 3. How To Achieve Consistent Wealth Growth

## Step 1: Track Your Money

You need to know 2 things:

1. How much you make
2. How much you're spending

Basically, do personal accounting on a spreadsheet or an app.

## Step 2: Analyze Your Results

If your spreadsheet shows you are making money, you are on a good path.

## Step 3: Make Improvements

If your spreadsheet shows you are not building wealth, then you must make changes.
Building wealth is a marathon and not a sprint. Start making changes to cut expenses,
even if those are small (more often manageable) changes.

In summary, the goal is to be aware of your own spending and know where your money goes. Be
mindful when spending and make good decisions.

# Ch. 4. How To Invest Properly

To build wealth you must put money to work. While the idea of quick gains in investing can be tempting, it is crucial to approach investing with a long-term, defensive mindset.

## The Proper Way To Invest

To accelerate your wealth-building, the best strategy is simple:

> ***<span style="color:yellow;">increase your income and invest more money.</span>***

This ensures steady growth without jeopardizing your financial security. The more money you can invest safely, the faster your wealth will compound over time.

***<span style="color:yellow;">Never put your financial future at risk by chasing risky high returns. Instead, focus on reliable, conservative investments that offer consistent growth over time.</span>***

## Beware of Speculative Investments

Relying on speculation to build wealth is like depending on winning the lottery to achieve financial freedom.

It is okay to engage in speculative investments occasionally, but do so in moderation. If you decide to speculate, only use a small portion of your portfolio - that would be money you can afford to lose without jeopardizing your financial goals.

## The Power of Compound Growth

The power of compound growth is immense. It is slow at the beginning, but then it gets really exciting!

Consider an example where you double your amount of money every day for 30 days while starting with a penny:

- Day 1: $0.01
- Day 2: $0.02
- Day 3: $0.04
- Day 4: $0.08
- Day 5: $0.16
- Day 6: $0.32
- Day 7: $0.64
- Day 8: $1.28
- Day 9: $2.56
- Day 10: $5.12
- Day 11: $10.24
- Day 12: $20.48
- Day 13: $40.96
- Day 14: $81.92
- Day 15: $163.84
- Day 16: $327.68
- Day 17: $655.36
- Day 18: $1,310.72
- Day 19: $2,621.44
- Day 20: $5,242.88
- Day 21: $10,485.76
- Day 22: $20,971.52
- Day 23: $41,943.04
- Day 24: $83,886.08
- Day 25: $167,772.16
- Day 26: $335,544.32
- Day 27: $671,088.64
- Day 28: $1,342,177.28
- Day 29: $2,684,354.56
- Day 30: $5,368,709.12

Time is your greatest ally in harnessing the power of compounding growth. The earlier you start investing, the more time your money has to grow.

> ***<span style="color:yellow;">Treat your investments as off-limits until you reach financial freedom.</span>***

## Conservative Investment Options

### Index Funds and ETFs

These track market indexes, such as the S&P 500, offering diversification and reduced risk. For example, investing in an S&P 500 index fund means you are buying a broad mix of top US companies, which lowers risk while supporting long-term growth.

### Bonds

Bonds are fixed-income investments where you lend money to a corporation or government in exchange for interest payments. They typically offer more safety than stocks but with lower returns.

### Real Estate

Thoughtful investing in real estate can provide both rental income and property appreciation. Whether residential or commercial, real estate can be a stable income source.
