# Why sprint planning matters

- Sets a clear, achievable Sprint Gload
- Creates team alignment and shared purpose
- Prevents overcommitment & chaos
- Balances demand with team capacity

# Sprint Planninng Agenda (30 mins or less)

1. Confirm Sprint Goal (5 min)
    - Why this sprint matters & what success looks like

    **Explanation:**

    - **Confirm Sprint Goal (5 min):**  
      Begin by agreeing on the main objective for the sprint. This ensures everyone understands the purpose and what a successful outcome looks like.

2. Review Backlog Items (10 mins)
    - Clarify top items, answer key questions

    **Explanation:**

    - **Review Backlog Items (10 mins):**  
      Go through the highest-priority tasks in the backlog. The team discusses each item to clarify requirements, resolve uncertainties, and ensure everyone is on the same page.

3. Estimate & Select Work (10 mins)
    - Use affinity estimating or review pre-refined items

    **Explanation:**

    - **Estimate & Select Work (10 mins):**  
      Spend 10 minutes estimating the effort required for upcoming tasks and choosing which ones to work on next.

    - **Affinity estimating:**  
      A quick, group-based technique where team members sort tasks into categories (such as "small," "medium," or "large") based on perceived effort, rather than assigning exact numbers. This enables rapid estimation of many items.

    - **Pre-refined items:**  
      Tasks that have already been discussed and clarified in advance, making them ready for estimation and selection.

    **Summary:**  
    In this step, the team quickly estimates the size of tasks (using affinity estimation or by reviewing already-prepared items) and selects which ones to include in the upcoming sprint.

4. Confirm Commitment (5 mins)
    - Align on Sprint Goal & finalize plan

    **Explanation:**

    - **Confirm Commitment (5 mins):**  
      The team reviews the selected work and confirms that everyone is committed to achieving the sprint goal. This step ensures alignment and agreement before starting the sprint.

# The Role of the Sprint Goal

- Acts as a North Star for hte team
- Keeps focus when unexpected issues arise
- Turns a list of tasks into a meaningful outcome
