The only hting that stood out in this book for me is the ability of Kurtz to bring out hte best in people, therefore, to lead. 

How can someone so strong and fearless be liked by other men and at hte same time listened to?

Does he not awaken the fear in them? The complex of inferiority? 

How does he make them feel good? How can he make them shine by bringing their strengths to the front, while still being seen as a leader and not giving away his power?


## Key Takeaway

Being tall and strong already grants “first-glance authority.” What wins lasting friendship is the paradox Kurtz half-understood: Use that authority to make others feel taller in your shadow. Do that consistently, and people won’t just respect you—they’ll enjoy being around you.
