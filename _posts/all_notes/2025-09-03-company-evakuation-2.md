# The 7-Step Blueprint for Evaluating a Generational Company

The speaker outlines a framework for spotting companies with the potential to create massive long-term wealth. The approach is based on seven elements:

## 1. Engineering (Revolutionary Technology)
- The product or technology must be **10x better** than existing alternatives.  
- Incremental improvements aren’t enough — it should feel like going from a **horse to a car**.  
- Competitors should look outdated in comparison.

## 2. Timing (Perfect Market Entry)
- Launching too early or too late kills even good ideas.  
- The company must enter the market **exactly when demand and infrastructure align**.  
- Success comes from being “on time,” not ahead of time.

## 3. Monopoly (Market Dominance)
- Aim for a position where **customers can’t easily switch away**.  
- Features:  
  - High retention rates  
  - Strong pricing power  
  - Premium product positioning  
- Goal: **Own the market** rather than compete in it.

## 4. People (Leadership & Talent)
- “Superstars hire superstars; bozos hire bozos.”  
- Needs:  
  - A visionary founder or leadership trio  
  - Builders and engineers, not just talkers  
  - Incentives aligned through **equity ownership** (not just salaries)  

## 5. Distribution (Scalable Sales Engine)
- Ability to **scale onboarding and sales quickly**.  
- Secure large clients and expand accounts.  
- Shorten the sales funnel with approaches that deliver **value in days, not months**.

## 6. Durability (Resilience & Moat)
- Product/system must be **impossible or inefficient to copy**.  
- Architecture should be designed for long-term defensibility.  
- Must withstand unpredictable shocks: wars, pandemics, regulations, etc.  
- High switching costs and sticky recurring revenue create long-term resilience.

## 7. Secret Sauce (Contrarian Advantage)
- A **unique, out-of-the-box insight** that others missed.  
- Should initially seem unbelievable, then become obvious when it’s too late for competitors.  
- Must position the company as a **leader, not a chaser**.
