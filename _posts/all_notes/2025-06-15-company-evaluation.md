# Company Evaluation

## Profit Margin

Percentage of revenue the company keeps as profits after all the expenses.

$(Revenue-Expenses)/Revenue = Net Profit Margin (\%) $

## Balance Sheet

### Debt to Equity Ratio

1. Find out how much is the company in debt.
2. Find out how much money the company has in equity.

In simple terms, debt to equity ratio shows how much the company owes vs. how much the company owns.

You want the company to have debt to equity ratio as small as possible.

## P/E Ratio (Profit to Earnings ratio)

Higher P/E ratio tipically means higher growth expectations.

Given the P/E ratio, youb can compare the price of the stock with its competitors.

## Company Growth Speed

### PEG Ratio

PEG Ratio - Divides PE Ratio by the Earnings Growth of the company.

- PEG ratio below 1 indicates potential undervaluation.
- PEG ratio around 1 suggests fair value
- PEG ratio over 1 indicates overvaluation


# Company Evaluation: A Holistic Approach

Evaluating a company for investment or business analysis is not just about looking at individual numbers; it's about understanding how various financial and qualitative components interrelate to form a complete picture of its health, performance, and future potential. Think of it like a puzzle where each piece, while important on its own, only reveals the full image when connected to the others.

## 1. Profitability: The Engine of Value Creation

Profitability metrics show how efficiently a company converts its revenue into profits. They are foundational because sustainable profits are essential for a company's long-term survival and growth.

### 1.1. Net Profit Margin

The percentage of revenue the company keeps as profits after all expenses, including taxes and interest. A higher net profit margin indicates greater efficiency in converting sales into actual profit.

$\frac{(Revenue - Expenses)}{Revenue} = Net Profit Margin (\%)$

* **Interpretation:** A higher net profit margin is generally better. It indicates that the company is good at controlling costs relative to its sales. Compare it to industry averages and the company's historical performance.

### 1.2. Gross Profit Margin

The percentage of revenue left after deducting the cost of goods sold (COGS). It shows how much profit a company makes from its sales before covering operating expenses, interest, and taxes.

$\frac{(Revenue - Cost~of~Goods~Sold)}{Revenue} = Gross Profit Margin (\%)$

* **Interpretation:** A high gross profit margin suggests that the company has good control over its production costs or strong pricing power.

### 1.3. Operating Profit Margin (EBIT Margin)

The percentage of revenue remaining after deducting operating expenses (like salaries, rent, and utilities) but *before* accounting for interest and taxes. This shows the profitability of the company's core operations.

$\frac{Operating~Income~(EBIT)}{Revenue} = Operating Profit Margin (\%)$

* **Interpretation:** This metric is crucial for understanding the efficiency of a company's day-to-day operations.

---

**How Profitability Metrics Relate:**

* **Gross Profit Margin** is the starting point. A healthy gross margin indicates good product-level profitability or strong pricing power.
* **Operating Profit Margin** builds on the gross margin by accounting for operational efficiency. A strong operating margin means the company effectively manages its selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) costs.
* **Net Profit Margin** is the ultimate bottom line, reflecting all expenses, including financing costs (interest) and taxes. A company might have a good gross margin, but if it has high operating expenses or significant debt (leading to high interest payments), its net profit margin could be low.

## 2. Financial Health and Solvency (Balance Sheet Analysis)

The balance sheet provides a snapshot of a company's assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific point in time. It's essential for assessing a company's financial stability and its ability to meet its obligations.

### 2.1. Debt-to-Equity Ratio

This ratio compares a company's total liabilities (what it owes) to its shareholder equity (what it owns after liabilities are paid). It indicates the extent to which a company's operations are funded by debt versus equity.

$\frac{Total~Debt}{Shareholder~Equity} = Debt-to-Equity~Ratio$

* **Interpretation:**
    * You generally want the company to have a **debt-to-equity ratio as small as possible**, or at least reasonable for its industry.
    * A high ratio can indicate a company is relying heavily on debt, which can increase financial risk, especially in an economic downturn or if interest rates rise.
    * However, some industries (e.g., utilities) are more capital-intensive and may naturally have higher debt levels. Context is key.

### 2.2. Current Ratio

Measures a company's ability to pay off its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets.

$\frac{Current~Assets}{Current~Liabilities} = Current~Ratio$

* **Interpretation:** A current ratio of 1.5-2.0 or higher is often considered healthy, indicating the company has enough liquid assets to cover its short-term obligations. A ratio below 1 could signal liquidity problems.

---

**How Financial Health Metrics Relate:**

* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio** directly impacts **Net Profit Margin**. High debt leads to higher interest expenses, which eats into net profit. A company with less debt generally has more flexibility and can better withstand economic shocks.
* **Current Ratio** provides insight into short-term liquidity, which is crucial for day-to-day operations. A company could be profitable (good margins) but still face bankruptcy if it can't meet its immediate cash obligations (poor current ratio). These ratios are crucial for assessing the **sustainability** of the profits shown in the income statement.

## 3. Valuation Metrics: Price vs. Value

Valuation metrics help determine if a company's stock price is reasonable relative to its earnings, growth, or assets. They connect the company's operational performance to its market perception.

### 3.1. P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings Ratio)

Compares a company's current share price to its earnings per share (EPS). It indicates how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a company's earnings.

$\frac{Share~Price}{Earnings~Per~Share~(EPS)} = P/E~Ratio$

* **Interpretation:**
    * **Higher P/E ratio typically means higher growth expectations.** Investors are willing to pay more for each dollar of earnings because they anticipate strong future growth.
    * Given the P/E ratio, you can **compare the price of the stock with its competitors** and the overall market. A high P/E relative to peers might suggest overvaluation, while a low P/E might suggest undervaluation (but also could signal problems).
    * It's important to use the P/E ratio in conjunction with other metrics, especially growth.

### 3.2. PEG Ratio (Price/Earnings to Growth Ratio)

This ratio refines the P/E ratio by factoring in the company's expected earnings growth rate. It's particularly useful for growth companies.

$\frac{P/E~Ratio}{Earnings~Growth~Rate~(\%)} = PEG~Ratio$

* **Interpretation:**
    * **PEG ratio below 1 indicates potential undervaluation.** This suggests that the stock is trading at a discount relative to its earnings growth potential.
    * **PEG ratio around 1 suggests fair value.** The stock's price is in line with its growth expectations.
    * **PEG ratio over 1 indicates potential overvaluation.** The stock's price may be too high given its expected earnings growth.
    * **Important Note:** The earnings growth rate used in the PEG ratio is often a forward-looking estimate, which can be subject to analyst biases.

---

**How Valuation Metrics Relate:**

* The **P/E Ratio** is directly dependent on the company's **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**, which comes from its **Net Profit Margin** and number of shares outstanding. A highly profitable company with strong net margins will likely have higher EPS, influencing its P/E.
* The **PEG Ratio** directly links **P/E** to **Company Growth Speed (specifically EPS growth)**. A company with high P/E might not be overvalued if its earnings are growing rapidly. This ratio helps justify or question a high P/E. It connects current market price with future expectations.

## 4. Company Growth Speed: The Future Potential

Beyond just current profitability, understanding a company's growth trajectory is crucial for long-term investment. Growth fuels future profits and higher valuations.

### 4.1. Revenue Growth

The rate at which a company's sales are increasing over time.

$\frac{(Current~Year~Revenue - Previous~Year~Revenue)}{Previous~Year~Revenue} = Revenue~Growth~(\%)$

* **Interpretation:** Consistent, strong revenue growth indicates increasing demand for the company's products or services.

### 4.2. Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth

The rate at which a company's earnings per share are increasing.

$\frac{(Current~Year~EPS - Previous~Year~EPS)}{Previous~Year~EPS} = EPS~Growth~(\%)$

* **Interpretation:** EPS growth is a key driver of stock price appreciation.

---

**How Growth Metrics Relate:**

* **Revenue Growth** is the primary driver of **EPS Growth**. Without increasing sales, it's difficult to grow profits sustainably (unless through aggressive cost-cutting, which has limits).
* Strong and consistent **EPS Growth** is what typically justifies a higher **P/E Ratio** and leads to a more favorable **PEG Ratio**. It signifies that the company is effectively translating its increased sales into greater shareholder value.
* Rapid growth often requires investment, which can sometimes temporarily suppress **Profit Margins** as the company prioritizes expansion. Therefore, it's important to assess if growth is sustainable and eventually leads to improved profitability.

## 5. Efficiency: Making the Most of Resources

Efficiency metrics show how well a company uses its assets and liabilities to generate sales and profits.

### 5.1. Asset Turnover Ratio

Measures how efficiently a company is using its assets to generate sales.

$\frac{Net~Sales}{Average~Total~Assets} = Asset~Turnover~Ratio$

* **Interpretation:** A higher ratio indicates that the company is more efficiently using its assets to generate revenue. This ratio is particularly useful for comparing companies within the same industry.

---

**How Efficiency Metrics Relate:**

* **Asset Turnover** directly impacts **Revenue Growth** and indirectly impacts **Profit Margins**. A company that efficiently utilizes its assets (high asset turnover) can generate more sales with less capital, which can lead to higher profits for a given level of sales.
* Efficiency metrics explain *how* a company achieves its profitability. For example, two companies might have similar net profit margins, but one might achieve it through high sales volume and low margins (high asset turnover, e.g., a discount retailer), while the other achieves it through low sales volume and high margins (low asset turnover, e.g., a luxury brand).

## 6. Qualitative Factors: The Intangibles

While financial metrics are crucial, they don't tell the whole story. Qualitative factors provide context and insights into the sustainability of the numbers.

### 6.1. Management Quality and Leadership

* **Experience and Track Record:** Does the management team have a history of success?
* **Vision and Strategy:** Do they have a clear plan for the company's future?
* **Integrity:** Are they ethical and trustworthy?

### 6.2. Competitive Advantage (Moat)

What makes the company stand out from its competitors? This "moat" protects its profitability and market share.

* **Brand Strength:** (e.g., Apple, Coca-Cola)
* **Patents/Proprietary Technology:** (e.g., pharmaceutical companies)
* **Network Effects:** (e.g., social media platforms)
* **Cost Advantage:** (e.g., Walmart)
* **High Switching Costs:** (e.g., specialized software providers)

### 6.3. Industry Outlook and Trends

* Is the industry growing or declining?
* Are there new technologies or disruptive forces emerging?
* What is the regulatory environment like?

### 6.4. Product/Service Quality and Innovation

* Is the company offering compelling products/services?
* Is it innovating and adapting to market changes?

### 6.5. Corporate Governance

* How is the company governed? Are shareholder interests prioritized?

---

**How Qualitative Factors Relate to Quantitative Metrics:**

* **Management Quality and Competitive Advantage (Moat)** are paramount. Strong management can drive **revenue growth**, improve **profit margins** through efficiency, and manage **debt** responsibly. A strong competitive advantage protects these profits and ensures their sustainability, making the company more attractive to investors (potentially leading to a higher **P/E ratio**). Without a moat, even high current profits might be fleeting.
* **Industry Outlook and Trends** set the stage for a company's potential **growth speed**. A company in a declining industry will struggle to show significant revenue or EPS growth, regardless of how well it's managed. Conversely, a company in a booming industry can achieve strong growth even with average execution.
* **Product/Service Quality and Innovation** are the drivers behind **revenue growth** and **gross profit margins**. Innovative products often command higher prices and foster brand loyalty.
* **Corporate Governance** ensures that the management acts in the best interest of shareholders, which indirectly supports long-term profitability and a reasonable **P/E ratio**. Poor governance can lead to financial mismanagement, impacting all financial metrics negatively.

## Conclusion: The Interconnected Puzzle

Evaluating a company is a holistic process where each financial ratio and qualitative factor influences and is influenced by the others.

* A company with a strong **competitive moat** and excellent **management** is more likely to achieve consistent **revenue and EPS growth**.
* This growth, combined with efficient operations (good **profit margins** and **asset turnover**), leads to healthy **net profits**.
* These strong and growing profits, when viewed in the context of the company's **financial health** (manageable **debt** and good **liquidity**), make the company an attractive investment.
* Market participants then reflect this attractiveness in the stock price, leading to a potentially higher **P/E ratio**, which, when justified by **earnings growth**, can still represent fair value (as indicated by the **PEG ratio**).

By understanding these interrelationships, you can move beyond just memorizing formulas to truly comprehending the dynamics of a business and making more informed evaluations.
